Hi there! 🖖

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile. As a junior developer, I may not have all the answers, but I have a huge growth potential and a passion for learning. 📈 Here are some of the technologies I'm currently working with:

- 🦄 **TypeScript**: I may be a junior, but I'm a TypeScript whiz in the making. Give me a complex type system and I'll conquer it.
- 🐭 **Golang**: I may not be a senior Go developer yet, but I'm learning quickly and already have a solid foundation in concurrent programming.
- 🐍 **Python**: I'm no snake charmer, but I can slither my way around a Python codebase with ease.
- 💻 **React**: I may be a beginner with React, but I'm eager to learn more and build awesome user interfaces.
- 💥 **AWS** serverless stack: I may not be a serverless expert yet, but I'm excited to learn and build scalable, cost-effective applications on AWS.

I hope you enjoy looking through my projects. I'm always open to feedback and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. 🚀
