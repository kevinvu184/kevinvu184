Hi there! ðŸ––

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile. As a junior developer, I may not have all the answers, but I have a huge growth potential and a passion for learning. ðŸ“ˆ Here are some of the technologies I'm currently working with:

- ðŸ¦„ **TypeScript**: I'm just getting started with TypeScript, but I'm a TypeScript whiz in the making. Give me a complex type system and I'll conquer it.
- ðŸ’» **React**: I may be a beginner with React, but I'm eager to learn more and build awesome user interfaces.
- ðŸ’¥ **AWS** serverless stack: I may not be a serverless expert yet, but I'm excited to learn and build scalable, cost-effective applications on AWS.

I hope you enjoy looking through my projects. I'm always open to feedback and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. ðŸš€
